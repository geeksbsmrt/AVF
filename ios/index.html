				<h2>Accessibility</h2>
					<h3>More accessible HTML</h3>
						<p>One of the first things that comes to mind when creating accessible HTML is using proper tags to make a screen readers job easier.  Many people also mention alt tags for images.  However, many people sometimes overlook other forms of accessibility like colorblindness or users with less than optimal vision.  While the colorblindness is slightly harder to tackle from easing accessibility, it is very easy to combat issues when presenting for users with difficulty viewing small text or images.  Instead of hard-coding text sizes or image sizes, we should use percentages and relative points to allow the user’s browser to scale text and images based on the user’s settings.</p>
 					<h3>Common Accessibility Issues</h3>
						<p>Extremely common complaints with accessibility features include not being able to understand the screen reader due to sound of the “voice”, inability of the reader to correctly pronounce the words, and poor feedback to users with sight problems.  A few years back, Google offered a free phone information service.  Users would call and request the phone number they wanted by speaking their query.  While Google was offering this service, they collected the voice data and have built one of the best voice recognition engines available.  This could be used to not only allow navigation on mobile devices but to provide proper feedback and even a more natural sounding screen reader.</p>
 					<h3>Accessible Devices</h3>
						<p>One of the best accessible devices available is still in its infancy and not yet widely adopted.  Many people are still unaware of its existence or the feasibility of using this technology in an accessible capacity.  Tactus Technology has developed an overlay for touchscreen devices that uses a morphing substance to create dynamic raised buttons on the screen of the device.  Not only does this provide better feedback, it allows for dynamically changing braille keyboards and better navigation by feel.  Another accessibility device that is sometimes overlooked because of its availability in the market is the touchscreen.  In a previous job, I worked for a school district that used touchscreens in all of its special needs classrooms.  This enabled students who could not physically operate a mouse and keyboard to easily navigate and utilize the computers.</p>
 					<h3>Accessible Mobile Apps</h3>
						<p>TapToTalk for iOS allows users who have a hard time talking or communicating to tap pictures or symbols on screen and the device will speak for them.  Code factory has developed the Wireless Accessibility application for the Android OS.  This application is designed for visually impaired users.  It uses large onscreen buttons, has a high contrast option, and includes its own screen reader for use outside of the application’s included launch screen.</p>

			<h3>Top Selling App Categories</h3>
				<p>According to research collected by Distimo and reported by gigaom.com (Kim, R), relating to the Apple iOS platform, the top applications are games.  The data collected shows that all games, both free and purchased, far exceed the next category, Entertainment, by 35 plus percent.  Data collected by App Data also shows a similar trend in Japan and the United Kingdom across iOS devices.  Android applications however, show a slightly different picture in the United States.  While games hold many of the top 10 application slots, entertainment and social networking applications also rank very highly in the United States. (AppData)</p>
 			<h3>Inferences based on Market Research</h3>
				<p>Based on the findings of the market research, users are currently turning to their mobile devices for entertainment and networking.  The largest section by far represented in the entertainment category is games.  This holds true across all platforms in all areas within my research.</p>
 			<h3>Average Bandwidth Cost and its Impact on Development</h3>
				<p>The Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) (Industry Association) found that mobile subscribers in the US spent more in 2012 on data than on voice for the first time ever.  The New York Times reports on a GSM 	Association study that shows the US spends three times more per gigabyte of data than their European counterparts.  These figures have been normalized into US dollars at $7.50 for the US per gigabyte and $2.50 on average in Europe (O’Brien, K).  JapanMobileTech points out that the New York Times speculated that these figures may also include overage, voice, and SMS charges.  They also show that data costs in Japan are the highest of the three coverage areas but the Japanese do not impose data limits on their subscribers (SBS).  To deal with increased data usage in the US, most mobile carriers have implemented “capped” data limits.  Subscribers who once had an unlimited data plan may find that their data speeds have been drastically reduced after hitting that “cap.”  Others without “unlimited” data will begin to incur overage charges on their monthly bill. (Gordon, W)  UK mobile users will also find themselves being charge an overage fee if they should exceed their allotted mobile data usage.  However, the European Union has set maximums that carriers can charge to subscribers in an attempt to keep communication costs low for the consumer. (Gordon, P)</p>
			<h3>App Development Suggested Strategy</h3>
				<p>These findings present a good case for developing applications that are self contained and limit dependence on mobile connectivity.  If an application must communicate with the internet, building in a warning for when the user is on a mobile network as opposed to WiFi or Bluetooth, would allow users to make informed decisions on whether or not to allow the app to access the remote data.  Also, adding in a data counter for your specific application could give users a positive experience by enabling them to see how your app compares to others in terms of data usage.  While Japan would be a great market to deploy in due to unlimited data usage, cost per unit of data is the highest compared to other markets.  Europe has the lowest cost per data unit but also the lowest data limits.  The US, while pricey compared to a few years ago, still offers the best rate per unit.</p>
